# Quick Start Guide 🚀

Welcome to the Flask Learning Journey! This guide will help you get started quickly.

## Step 1: Review the Learning Plan

Read the [LEARNING_PLAN.md](./LEARNING_PLAN.md) file to understand:
- The complete learning path
- What you'll learn in each module
- Projects you'll build
- Time estimates

## Step 2: Set Up Your Environment

### Install Python
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed:
```bash
python --version
```

### Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Flask
```bash
pip install flask
```

## Step 3: Start Learning

### Begin with Module 1
1. Open [LEARNING_PLAN.md](./LEARNING_PLAN.md)
2. Find Module 1: Flask Fundamentals
3. Work through each topic in order
4. Build the Module 1 project

### How to Get Help
When you're ready to learn a specific topic:
- Ask me: "Let's start Module 1, topic 1.1"
- Or: "Help me with routing in Flask"
- Or: "Let's build the Module 1 project"

## Step 4: Practice Regularly

- Code every day (even 30 minutes helps!)
- Build all the projects
- Experiment and try variations
- Don't skip ahead - master fundamentals first

## Recommended Learning Flow

1. **Read** the topic in LEARNING_PLAN.md
2. **Ask me** to explain or demonstrate the concept
3. **Code** along with examples
4. **Build** the module project
5. **Review** and understand what you built
6. **Move** to the next topic

## Tips for Success

✅ Complete each module before moving to the next  
✅ Build the projects - don't just read  
✅ Ask questions when stuck  
✅ Experiment and break things (then fix them!)  
✅ Take notes in the `resources/` directory
