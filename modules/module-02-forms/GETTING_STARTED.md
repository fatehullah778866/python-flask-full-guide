## Common Questions ❓

### "Do I need to know HTML?"
Basic HTML knowledge helps, but we'll explain everything! You'll learn as you go.

### "What if I don't understand something?"
That's okay! Re-read the lesson, try the code, and ask questions. Learning takes time!

### "How long will this take?"
Take your time! Some people finish in a few hours, others take a day or two. Go at your own pace!

### "Can I skip Flask-WTF?"
I don't recommend it! Flask-WTF is the standard way and makes forms much easier and safer.
