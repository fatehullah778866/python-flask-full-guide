## Common Questions ❓

### "Which platform should I use?"
For beginners: **Heroku, Railway, or Render** - they're the easiest!

### "Do I need to pay?"
Many platforms have free tiers for learning. Check each platform's pricing.

### "What if something goes wrong?"

- Review error messages
- Test locally first
- Ask for help!

### "Do I need a domain name?"
Not required! Platforms give you a free URL. You can add a custom domain later.

## What Success Looks Like ✅

You'll know you're ready when you can:
- ✅ Prepare apps for production
- ✅ Deploy to a platform
- ✅ Configure environment variables
- ✅ Set up WSGI server
- ✅ Monitor your app
- ✅ Fix common issues

## Next Steps After Module 9 🚀

Once you complete this module, you'll be ready for:
- **Module 10**: Advanced Topics

But first, deploy your app and celebrate! 🎉

## Remember 💡

- **Start simple** - Use PaaS for first deployment
- **Test locally** - Always test production config first
- **Use environment variables** - Never commit secrets
- **Monitor logs** - Check what's happening
- **Backup database** - Before any changes
- **Be patient** - Deployment takes practice

## Let's Begin! 🎉

Start with `01-deployment-preparation.md` and work through each lesson.
